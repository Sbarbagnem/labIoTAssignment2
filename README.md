CORE:
The idea is to build a system for monitoring the health of a bedridden home-patient. By following a building-block approach, you have to integrate such an health monitoring system with the one that you developed as first assignment. In practice, the home monitoring system of the first assignment is the collector of all the measurements, and then it has to manage data collection, event detection and alerting. The health parameters that should be monitored are at least: heart beat and body movements.  The new monitoring system communicates only by using the MQTT protocol. 


ADD-ONS
Set up a remote control of the monitoring system (start, stop, etc.) through a web page, or a telegram bot. All the sensed values and alerting events values must be showed.


INGREDIENTS:
Micros of your choice, suggested: NodeMCU and MKR1000
